# Portugese Banks had conducted a telemarketing campaign for a term-deposit product. Through the campaign, they had collected the data about
# the prospects' demographics, other financial products they have purchased in the past (loans, deposits etc.), the number of times hey were 
# called etc. They also recorded the response data, i.e. whether the person had subscribed to the term-deposit product, which is the target variable.

# The marketing team of the bank wants to launch yet another telemarketing campaign for the same product. You, an analyst at the bank, want to
# answer the following questions using the past data:
# Which prospects are more likely to buy the product (i.e. to respond )?
# Which attributes determine the propensity to buy a term-deposit?  
# Once you predict the likelihood of response, how many prospects should you target for telemarketing?
# By how much can you reduce the marketing cost using the model, and how many prospects will you acquire?

#-----------
#Conclusion
#-----------

# After sucessfully building the model and sorting the data based on decreasing order of probability of response, we came to know that
# by targeting top 50% (5th decile) prospects, we can reach top 80% of the total responders with minimum cost.
